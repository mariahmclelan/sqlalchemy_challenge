# sqlalchemy_challenge

For this project I used pythomn and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analyis and data exploration of a database.

Using SQLAlchemy ORM queries I was able to analyse the data to find the most recent date and then get 12 months of data up to the most recent date. I created a barg graoph to show the precipitation in inches for each date. Then I found out which station was the most active to create a histogram of observed temperatures form that station.

After creating my quereies and analysing the data I created a Flask api based on the information.
